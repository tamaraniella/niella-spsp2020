# Moral and political polarization: More consensus in face-to-face discussions than expected

## Tamara Niella & Sara D. Hodges

### University of Oregon, Psychology Department 

#### When thinking about how to enhance communication on polarizing issues, an important factor to consider is people’s beliefs about such interactions. In this study we compared people’s expectations about reaching consensus in face-to-face conversation when imagining such discussions, with the actual proportion of consensus agreements that result from two people discussing an issue face-to-face. Our results show that, for certain issues, the percentage of dyads who reached agreement in the face-to-face discussion was significantly higher than the percentage of participants who imagined reaching agreement. In other words, people seem to underestimate the power of face-to-face conversations.
